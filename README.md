Shortest path among 3 points A,B and C.

I can recall dijkastraâ€™s Algorithm for finding the shortest path if the person wishes to search
for nearest restaurant from his home.


Pseudo code for algorithm:  

If (D[u]+c(u,v)<D[v])           D[u]-distance of starting node;
D[v]=D[u]+c(u,v).         D[v]-distance of final node;  
 c(u,v)-cost from going one node to other
